# node-fullstack

A toolkit to build composable nodejs dom,http,microservice platforms.

node-fullstack provides bin scripts & helper modules that form the core of a light weight fullstack nodejs implementation.

## Philosophy

There are a few differences between node-fullstack & conventional nodejs packages.

### Directory Structure

The directory structure is organized by the domain model. Framework directory structures are not used (i.e. an app directory).

The tests are intermixed with the production code. Browserify & Watchify manage which files are built into the bundles.

This is inspired by "Uncle" Bob Martin. See <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2011/09/30/Screaming-Architecture.html" target="_blank">Screaming Architecture</a>

## Usage
